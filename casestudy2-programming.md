## Part 1: Getting Started
We learned how to record the environment's temperature and humidity in the earlier lessons and send the information to a cloud database. We will now learn how to use a GUI application to retrieve the data from the database and notify the user when the sensor reading deviates from the expected range.

Before obtaining data from the cloud database, the sensor must be turned on and the **`sensor.py`** should be running so that data can be continuously uploaded to the database.

1. Power on the ROCK PI device and log in using the provided username and password.
2. Connect to the WIFI network.
   
   i.  Click the Networks icon in the taskbar, and then click the down arrrow next to BU-Standard and select Configure...

9. Get back the **`sensor.py`** you have completed in **workshop 2** and save it to the MyProject folder.
  
    ```python
      from smbus2 import SMBus
      import time
      from pymongo import MongoClient
      import datetime
      
      # Your URI copied from the MongoDB Atlas website      
      uri = 'mongodb+srv://scie1006:password@cluster0...:27017/'
      client = MongoClient(uri)
      db = client.database

      bus = SMBus(7)
    
      # The code block inside while True loop repeats continuously until 
      # you press Ctrl+C in the terminal
      while True:
         # trigger the sensor to do measurement
         bus.write_i2c_block_data(0x38, 0xAC, [0x33, 0x00]) 
         # wait for 0.5 seconds
         time.sleep(0.5)
         # read data from the sensor
         data = bus.read_i2c_block_data(0x38, 0x00, 8)

         temp = ((data[3] & 0x0F) << 16) | (data[4] << 8) | data[5]
         humi = ((data[1] << 16) | (data[2] << 8) | data[3]) >> 4
         
         temperature = temp / (2**20) * 200 - 50
         print(u'Temperature: {0:.1f}°C'.format(temperature))

         humidity = humi / (2**20) * 100
         print(u'Humidity: {0:.1f}%'.format(humidity))         
         
         record = {
            "sensor_id": 1,
            "temp": temperature,
            "humi": humidity,
            "date": datetime.datetime.now(),
         }
         
         db.sensors.insert_one(record)
         
         # wait for 60 seconds
         time.sleep(60) 
      ```

10.  Run the **`sensor.py`** program.

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



   
## Part 2: Retrieving data from MongoDB

1. Right-click the desktop of the notebook computer, choose New, and then Folder to create a new folder called `MyApp`.
   *(Note: You can also do this part on the ROCK Pi.)*
   
   ![Alt text](images/new-folder-win.png) ![Alt text](images/new-folder-win2.png)
   
2. Click the Start icon, and choose Visual Studio Code from the start menu.
   
   ![Alt text](images/vs-win.png)
   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

3. Choose Open Folder from the File menu.

   ![Alt text](images/vs-openfolder-win.png)
4. After finding the MyApp folder on Desktop, click Select Folder.

   ![Alt text](images/vs-openfoler-win2.png)
   
5. In Explorer, click the New File... button to create a file called **`gui.py`**.
   
   ![Alt text](images/vs-newfile-win.png)
   
6. First, we need to connect to the MongoDB database with the following code:

    ```python
    from pymongo import MongoClient
    import datetime

    # Your URI copied from the MongoDB Atlas website    
    uri = 'mongodb+srv://scie1006:password@cluster0...:27017/'
    client = MongoClient(uri)
    db = client.database
    collection = db.sensors      
    ```
7. To retrieve data from the MongoDB, we need to use the `find()` method. We sort the data by date and get the last record for the latest data.

    ```python
    # Get the last record from the collection (sorted by "date")
    lastRecord = collection.find().sort("date", -1).limit(1)[0]    
    ```

8. The temperature value can be obtained by `lastRecord['temp']`. To print the result, we write:
   ```python
   print("Temperature: {0:.1f} °C".format(lastRecord['temp']))
   ```
   
9. **Exercise: Retrieving the humidity data from the cloud database**

   Write code in the program to retrieve the humidity data from MongoDB and print it out. The humidity value can be obtained by `lastRecord['humi']`.

   ```python
   # Exercise: Retrieving the humidity data from the cloud database
   # Fill out the ... below
   
   print("....".format(...))
   ```

   *Sample output*

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
  
## Part 3: Building a GUI Application with pygame

In this part, we will use the `pygame` library to create the GUI.

1. Let's import the library and initialize it at the top of the program. Put the following code **after** the `import datetime` statement.
   ```python
   import pygame 

   # initialize the pygame library and prepare it for use
   pygame.init() 
   ```
2. For a GUI application, we have to set the window size and name. Put the following code **after** `pygame.init()`.
   ```python
   # set window size to 400x300 pixels
   window = pygame.display.set_mode((400, 300))   
   # set the window name
   pygame.display.set_caption('My Alert')   
   ```
3. Then, We create a font for text display and a clock to control the frame rate of the application. Put the following code **after** `pygame.display.set_caption('My Alert')`.
   ```python   
   # create a font Arial with size 30 for text display
   font = pygame.font.SysFont("Arial", 30)
   # create a clock to control frame rate
   clock = pygame.time.Clock()
   ```

   

4. We use a while loop to continuously retrieve data from the database. Put the following code right **before** the line `lastRecord = collection.find().sort("date", -1).limit(1)[0]`, then put this line and the rest of the program inside the loop by adding a <kdb>Tab</kdb> at the beginning of each line.
   ```python

   # The code block inside while True loop repeats continuously until 
   # you press Ctrl+C in the terminal
   while True:
       # process any pending events to ensure the application remains responsive
       pygame.event.pump()
   ```
   
5. Let's set the background color to white before we draw the text **at the end of the loop**.
   ```python
       # fill the window with white color by RGB code (255, 255, 255)
       window.fill((255, 255, 255))
   ```
   See [RGB Color Codes Chart](https://www.rapidtables.com/web/color/RGB_Color.html) for color code.

   ![Alt text](images/rgb-color.png)

   
   
6. To show text on the window, we first create a text surface and then draw it at a position. In pygame, positions are always supplied as an (X,Y) coordinate. This represents how many pixels to the right and how many pixels down the surface should be placed. Put the following code **at the end of the loop**.

   ![Alt tex](images/gui-coordinates.png)

   ```python
       # create a text surface with black color, RGB code (0, 0, 0)
       tempText = font.render("Temperature: {0:.1f}°C".format(lastRecord['temp']), True, (0, 0, 0))    

       # draw the tempText surface at the position (10, 10)
       window.blit(tempText, (10, 10))
   
   ```

   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

7. Finally, we update the display using `pygame.display.update()` to limit the frame rate to 1 frame per second using clock.tick(1). Put the following code **at the end of the loop**.
   ```python
       # update the display window
       pygame.display.update()      
       # set the frame rate to 1 frame per second
       clock.tick(1) 
   ```
8. **Exercise: Displaying humidity value in the window**
   
   Draw the humidity data on the window. Make it under the temperature data. You should put the code **before** the line `pygame.display.update()`.

   ```python
       # Exercise: Displaying humidity value in the window
       # Fill out the ... below
   
       # create a text surface with black color, RGB code (0, 0, 0)
       humiText = font.render(..., True, (0, 0, 0)) 

       # draw the humiText surface at the position (10, 40)
       window.blit(...)
   ```   

   *Sample output*

   ![Alt text](images/sample-output-gui.png)
   
   <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
   

## Part 4: Alerting the User with Colors

In this section, we will determine whether the temperature is within the normal range. The background color of the window will change to inform the user if the temperature rises above 28°C.

Let's **replace**  `window.fill((255, 255, 255))` with the following code:

```python
    if lastRecord['temp'] > 28:
       window.fill((255, 0, 0))  # red background
    else:
       window.fill((255, 255, 255)) # white background
```

The above code will change the background color to red if the temperature is higher than 28°C. Otherwise, it will change the background color to white.
